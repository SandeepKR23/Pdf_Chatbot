# Saleschat Chatbot Project: AI Chatbot Implementation in Low-Code Application.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered chatbot using advanced machine learning techniques and low-code development tools. The chatbot is capable of answering user queries by retrieving information from stored documents and offering intelligent, context-aware responses.

## Overview
The AI Chatbot is built using the LangChain framework and OpenAI models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo. It integrates QdrantDB as a vector store to enable semantic search on uploaded PDF documents, allowing users to ask questions and receive relevant, document-based answers. The chatbotâ€™s key function is to provide intelligent, contextually accurate responses by understanding user intent and leveraging embeddings for information retrieval.
